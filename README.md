# RoboNet-Tool

# For extacting images from original .hdf5 files:
# 1.Download get_metadata.py and hdf5_loader.py to a folder renamed "loader".
# 2.Run hdf5_loader.py and you will get a list called 'Robonet_Database'.
# 3.Please read the comments in hdf5_loader.py.
# For other tasks you may be interested in:
# 4.Download classification.py and prediction.py.

# Tools are far from efficient. I will update this repository once I make progress.
# Hope this could help you.
