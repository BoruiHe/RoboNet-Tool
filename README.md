# RoboNet-Tool

# For extacting images from original .hdf5 files:
# 1.Download and unzip the .zip file.
# 2.Make sure get_metadata.py and hdf5_loader.py are in a folder renamed "loader".
# 3.Run hdf5_loader.py and you will get a list called 'Robonet_Database'.
# 4.Please read the comments in hdf5_loader.py.
# For other tasks you may be interested in: 
# Explanation: classification.py simply identity which robot an image depicts. prediction.py is aiming to create an image which is very similar to the real image based on states vector.
# 5.classification.py works well. But prediction.py doesn't work at all.(Feb/26/2021) 

# I will update this repository once I make progress.
# Hope this could help you.
